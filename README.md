# HMM

Example based on explanation and pseudo-code provided by chapter 17 in Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin's book Speech and Language Processing. Link [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/A.pdf).

`numpy` is the only required package.

Simply run
```
python3 viterbi.py
```

or any other algos for the sake of demonstration.

The code is not well refactored for the time consideration.

All data is stored is data.py and imported in the other packages.
